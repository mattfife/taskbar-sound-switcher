Introduction
The Taskbar Sound Switcher is a Windows application that runs in the Windows Taskbar area. With a simple double-click, you can instantly change the audio output device from a list of pre-selected audio output devices on your computer.  A right-click allows you to select the device you want directly or you can re-select which devices you wish to toggle between.  Your selection is saved to a configuration file and remembered each time you start the app.
